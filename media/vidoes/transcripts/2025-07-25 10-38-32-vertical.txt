For those of you who want to get into building with AI, this is the most critical aspect of it that you're going to want to understand. And so when when your code, when the code is being written, it has to be written into something, right? It has to go into something, has to go into an application. It has to go into something like this.

This is called a development environment, right? This is a text and a code editor. And so all the code is in here and I can write the code. This is what a developer uses to be able to produce the code. And so the most popular most widely available is VS code right. It's open source and it's open. So what makes it special is that you're getting other companies forking, which just means that they're taking a copy of VS code and creating their own version of it, and they're implementing AI into it.

And so we have Cairo which is Amazon. We have cursor AI, we have windsurf. There's a couple others, but these are the most popular right now that are out. And so these are AI powered. You can use AI to help you generate and write the code. Now secondarily there's also terminal agents. This is a little more complex because now you can use your terminal which is of course connected to your computer.

You can also use AI powered terminals which is warp. I should have put that as a picture on here, but the terminal allows you to then also be able to create code. And so VS code can be can extend to either one of these. Right. You can have a VS code that can be forked into an AI powered application.

Or you can use VS code and have the terminal agent right into your code. You don't even need VS code to use terminal agents, but if you want to be able to see the file tree, some people just like being able to see the files in a terminal agent. You don't. You can't see the file. And I know this sounds really, really, really complex for those of you who don't understand, but this is where you go to ChatGPT and you start to ask ChatGPT what is VS code?

What are AI powered development environments? What are terminal code agents? How do I download VS code to my computer? How do I install a terminal agent on my on my on my on my computer? How do I begin to use an AI powered development environment? And this is what is going to spawn you into creating. If you can really start to create with these, then in at in the lovable is all the other applications right.

Are just streamlining in this. But this is like if you want to get to the core of how to do it, this is where you can begin to do it. And so let me know if you have any questions in the comments.
