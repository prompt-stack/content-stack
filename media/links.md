**Study Mode** in OpenAI ChatGPT is a feature launched in July 2025 that transforms ChatGPT from simply providing answers into an interactive, step-by-step learning partner designed to help users truly understand material. Rather than giving immediate solutions, Study Mode guides users through questions, prompts, and feedback—using methods inspired by the Socratic style—to encourage critical thinking and active learning[1][2][3].

Key details:
- **How it works:** When Study Mode is enabled (via the “Study and learn” tool), ChatGPT will respond with interactive queries, scaffolded hints, periodic quizzes, and knowledge checks instead of just supplying direct answers. It aims to adapt responses based on your knowledge level and learning goals[2][3].
- **Purpose:** The feature is specifically designed to help with homework, test preparation, and understanding new topics by providing personalized guidance and feedback, modeled after best practices from educational and cognitive science research[1][2][3].
- **Target audience:** It is built with both high school and college students in mind but is accessible to any user above the usual ChatGPT age threshold[2].
- **Availability:** Study Mode can be accessed by both free and paid users directly within the ChatGPT interface (look for a “Study” or “Study and learn” icon/tool)[2][4].
- **Control:** Users can toggle Study Mode on or off at any time. If turned off, ChatGPT reverts to its standard mode of answering directly[3].
- **Limitations:** While Study Mode reduces the risk of hallucinated (inaccurate) answers, it is not immune to errors. OpenAI recommends users (and especially educators) check outputs for accuracy and appropriateness[1][2]. 

In summary, OpenAI’s Study Mode in ChatGPT is intended to serve as a virtual tutor, prompting genuine engagement with learning material rather than enabling shortcut academic cheating[1][2][3][6].

Today we’re introducing study mode in ChatGPT—a learning experience that helps you work through problems step by step instead of just getting an answer. Starting today, it’s available to logged in users on Free, Plus, Pro, Team, with availability in ChatGPT Edu coming in the next few weeks.

ChatGPT is becoming one of the most widely used learning tools in the world. Students turn to it to work through challenging homework problems, prepare for exams, and explore new concepts. But its use in education has also raised an important question: how do we ensure it is used to support real learning, and doesn’t just offer solutions without helping students make sense of them?

We’ve built study mode to help answer this question. When students engage with study mode, they’re met with guiding questions that calibrate responses to their objective and skill level to help them build deeper understanding. Study mode is designed to be engaging and interactive, and to help students learn something—not just finish something.  



How study mode was built
Under the hood, study mode is powered by custom system instructions we’ve written in collaboration with teachers, scientists, and pedagogy experts to reflect a core set of behaviors that support deeper learning including: ​​encouraging active participation, managing cognitive load, proactively developing metacognition and self reflection, fostering curiosity, and providing actionable and supportive feedback. These behaviors are based on longstanding research in learning science and shape how study mode responds to students.

“Instead of doing the work for them, study mode encourages students to think critically about their learning. Features like these are a positive step toward effective AI use for learning. Even in the AI era, the best learning still happens when students are excited about and actively engaging with the lesson material.” —Robbie Torney, Senior Director of AI Programs at Common Sense Media.

Key features
Interactive prompts: Combines Socratic questioning, hints, and self-reflection prompts to guide understanding and promote active learning, instead of providing answers outright.

Scaffolded responses: Information is organized into easy-to-follow sections that highlight the key connections between topics, keeping information engaging with just the right amount of context and reducing overwhelm for complex topics.

Personalized support: Lessons are tailored to the right level for the user, based on questions that assess skill level and memory from previous chats.

Knowledge checks: Quizzes and open-ended questions, along with personalized feedback to track progress, support knowledge retention and the ability to apply that knowledge in new contexts.

Flexibility: Easily toggle study mode on and off during a conversation, giving you the flexibility to adapt to your learning goals in each conversation.

How students use study mode
Study mode was built with college students in mind. Some feedback we heard from students during early testing:

“The best way I’d describe it is a live, 24/7, all-knowing “office hours.” —Noah Campbell, college student 

“Study mode did a great job breaking down dense material into clear, well-paced explanations.” —Caleb Masi, college student 

“I put study mode to the test to tutor me on a concept I have attempted to learn many times before: sinusoidal positional encodings. It was like a tutor who doesn’t get tired of my questions. After a 3-hour working session, I finally understood it well enough to feel confident.” —Maggie Wang, college student

Last semester I took ACCT 1010 (introduction to accounting). I want to prepare myself for the second part of the class, ACCT 1020, which I am taking next semester. I have attached my notes/study guides from ACCT 1010. Help me relearn the material

Great — before we dive in, can you tell me:

What kind of support you're looking for? (e.g., review key terms, do practice questions together, explain concepts you struggled with?)
What grade or goal you’re aiming for in ACCT 1020?
Anything from ACCT 1010 that felt especially confusing or important to review first?
Once I know that, I’ll tailor a study plan just for you.

I felt very good about ACCT 1010 its just been a few months since I looked at the material. I want to review the entire course (everything included in the notes) before next semester. I want to make sure I hit every key term

Perfect. Since you already have a strong foundation from ACCT 1010, our focus can be on retrieval and application — making sure all the concepts are fresh and that you can use them confidently.

Here’s how I suggest we tackle it:

We'll go chapter by chapter based on your notes. For each, we'll:

1. Quickly preview the core ideas.

2. Review key terms — I’ll quiz you, not just define them.

3. Do a short application activity (e.g., mini-scenario, you teach me a term, or solve a logic puzzle).

4. Summarize + check understanding with a few wrap-up questions.

Let’s start with Chapter 1: A Framework for Financial Accounting.

Step 1: Quick Preview — You tell me.
Just to warm up your memory:

What’s the basic accounting equation?
What are the three main types of activities financial accounting tracks?
Give it a shot — no need to be perfect.

The basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity

The three main types of activities financial accounting tracks is operating, investing and financing

Perfect recall. That’s our foundation.

Next up — quick key term quiz. I’ll throw you three from Chapter 1. Try to define each in your own words. If anything’s fuzzy, I’ll help clarify.

1. Stockholders’ Equity

2. Revenues vs. Expenses

3. Dividends

Ready? Start with Stockholders’ Equity.

Stockholder's equity is the part of the company that is owned by creditors or investors.

revenue is how much company makes by selling of goods and services, expenses are the associated costs

Dividends are paid out to stockholder's

Nice job — you’re definitely close on all three. Let’s tighten them up just a bit together:

1. Stockholders' Equity — You said it's the part "owned by creditors or investors." Quick check: are creditors part of equity or something else?

2. On revenues vs. expenses, great start — can you add when they’re recognized? (Hint: it’s not always when cash is received or paid.)

3. For dividends, you nailed who they go to. Can you also say whether they’re considered an expense, and how they affect the accounting equation?

Let's tackle #1 first — want to revise your definition of stockholders’ equity now that I’ve nudged you a bit?

sorry you are right, creditors are owed liabilities. They are not part of stockholder's equity.

Exactly — nice catch.

So how would you now define stockholders’ equity, knowing it reflects owners’ claims, not creditors’?

Once you revise that, we’ll do quick follow-ups on revenue recognition and dividends.

Stockholder's equity is the owners/investors claims on the assets

Getting started 
Study mode is especially useful for homework help, test prep, and learning new topics. To try it, select “Study and learn” from tools in ChatGPT and ask a question.

Limitations and what’s next
This is a first step in a longer journey to improve learning in ChatGPT.  Today, study mode is powered by custom system instructions. We chose this approach because it lets us quickly learn from real student feedback and improve the experience—even if it results in some inconsistent behavior and mistakes across conversations. We plan on training this behavior directly into our main models once we’ve learned what works best through iteration and student feedback. 

We’re also exploring functionality to make study mode more engaging and helpful for students including:

Clearer visualizations for complex or text-heavy concepts
Goal setting and progress tracking across conversations
Deeper personalization tailored to each student’s skill level and goals
The research landscape is still taking shape on the best ways to apply AI in education. OpenAI is enabling further research on learning and AI through various partners in its NextGenAI⁠ initiative, and working with experts from the SCALE Initiative at Stanford University’s Accelerator for Learning⁠(opens in a new window) to study and share how AI tools influence learning outcomes in areas like K-12 education.

As we run longer-term studies on how students learn best with AI, we intend to publish a deeper analysis of what we’ve learned about the links between model design and cognition, shape future product experiences based on these insights, and work side by side with the broader education ecosystem to ensure AI benefits learners worldwide.
