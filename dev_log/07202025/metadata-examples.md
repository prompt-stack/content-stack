## ðŸŽ¯ Pattern Summary

### Content Type Detection
- **text**: Articles, blog posts, documentation (>100 words)
- **note**: Short reminders, todos, quick thoughts (<100 words)
- **code**: Code snippets, functions, scripts (contains code patterns)
- **document**: PDFs, Word docs (binary files with extracted text)
- **image**: PNG, JPG, screenshots (with AI description)
- **video**: Video files or video transcripts
- **data**: CSV, JSON, spreadsheets (structured data)

### LLM Categorization Logic
- **articles**: Long-form content, tutorials, documentation
- **notes**: Short thoughts, reminders, quick captures
- **code**: Programming-related content, scripts, configs
- **images**: Visual content, diagrams, screenshots
- **data**: Structured data, analytics, reports

### Filename Patterns
- **Articles**: `descriptive-title-{id}.md`
- **Code**: `function-name-{id}.js` or `descriptive-name-{id}.py`
- **Images**: `descriptive-name-{id}.png`
- **Data**: `original-filename-{id}.csv`
- **Notes**: `brief-description-{id}.md`

This gives the LLM clear patterns to follow for consistent categorization!
