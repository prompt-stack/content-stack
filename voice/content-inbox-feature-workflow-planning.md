# Content Inbox Feature Workflow Planning

All right, so we're going to be working on our first feature. I'm just thinking feature pages, what's the workflow? Should we just create a page or should we do it in the playground? But maybe we should create the page and then say, what are going to be the components needed? And so this is the primitive, because component features are a composition of components. And so we have to ask ourselves, what are going to be the components needed in order to be able to have this feature happen? 

So what do we want users to do? You're going to be able to land on the content inbox, and the content inbox is going to allow you to be able to submit content in four different ways. You can upload content, you can drag and drop content, you can paste in content, and you can provide a URL, which will be the content would then be extracted from it. And so we need to be able to have the, I want to first get the backend of this done. And so we have the folder system, set up, but I want to be able to start minimalist and then start to get, because I'm not sure what the total functionality, but that's what needs to be done. 

And so I want to have those options. Once I submit those options, I want them to go in a queue where I can sort them, I can get back to them. So I need to be able to just rapidly drop content. And then when I'm dropping the content, I need to be able to, so I'm thinking workflow for me, I get content while I'm on the internet, typically while I'm browsing, or then I create a lot of content on my phone. I talked to a lot of large language models, and so I want to extract content out of that. So I usually copy and paste it, but then I have my browser where I can link to it. And so sometimes I like to be able to add links to the pasted content that I submit. 

I think there's a world where I upload content that's already on my computer, so I can run it through this system so it can get its metadata, because basically this is a metadata table that I can use to get my metadata. It's metadata, because basically this is a metadata tagging. This is an intelligent system that when you put content in it, it gets metadata attached to it that is going to be able to then go. So look at this as like a Dewey decimal system for content. 

So I'm thinking, how do we start to begin to build? Do we start with a page, and that page becomes kind of the playground, and we try to build on it, and then we clean it up. We start simple, and we keep doing it, and it becomes like what we ultimately create, because this would be the inbox. So we would delete all the stuff that's in the current inbox page and start to build.
