Dear Journal,

What a week it's been. I've been thinking a lot about how much has changed in the past year, and I'm honestly amazed at where I am now compared to last January.

The promotion finally came through on Monday. After eighteen months of extra projects, weekend work, and what felt like endless presentations, I'm officially the Senior Product Manager. The imposter syndrome is real though - sitting in that first leadership meeting, I kept waiting for someone to say there'd been a mistake. But Sarah pulled me aside after and said something that stuck with me: "You're not here by accident. You earned this."

Started the new meditation app this morning. Day 4, and I'm already noticing I'm less reactive to minor annoyances. Like when the coffee machine broke at work today - old me would have let it ruin my morning, but I just laughed and walked to the caf√© down the street. Small wins.

Mom called tonight. She's finally considering the move to be closer to us. I know she's worried about leaving the house she shared with Dad for 40 years, but I think she's lonely. We talked for two hours about memories from that house - my first bike in the garage, the cherry tree Dad planted when I was born, the kitchen where she taught me to make her famous lasagna. Change is hard at any age, I suppose.

The startup idea is taking shape. Met with Marcus and Elena at the co-working space after work. We've narrowed it down to a mental health app specifically for remote workers. The market research looks promising, and Elena's technical mockups are incredible. We're giving ourselves until March to decide if we're really doing this. The thought of leaving a stable job terrifies me, but the regret of not trying might be worse.

Running has become my therapy. Hit a personal record today - 5 miles in 42 minutes. Six months ago, I couldn't run to the end of the block without wheezing. It's become my morning ritual: shoes on, podcast in, world out. There's something meditative about the rhythm of footfalls on pavement.

Relationship update: Jake and I had our first real fight in months. Not the explosive kind - the quiet, tense kind about money and future plans. He wants to buy a house; I want to travel while we're still young and flexible. We didn't resolve it, but we did agree to make a proper financial plan together. Growing up is weird. You think you'll have it all figured out by 30, and here I am at 32, still winging it half the time.

Three things I'm grateful for today:
1. The barista who remembered my name and order
2. The sunset I caught on my evening walk - pink and orange like watercolors
3. Having friends who challenge me to dream bigger

Goals for tomorrow:
- Finish the Q1 product roadmap
- Call Grandma (it's been too long)
- Try that new yoga class
- Don't check work emails after 7 PM (yeah, right)

Sometimes I read old entries and cringe at what I thought were huge problems. But I guess that's growth - your perspective shifts, your capacity expands, and what once seemed impossible becomes your new normal. Future me will probably read this and laugh at what I'm stressing about now.

Here's to continuing to figure it out, one day at a time.
