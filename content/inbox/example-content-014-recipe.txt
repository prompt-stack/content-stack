Grandma's Secret Chocolate Chip Cookies

This recipe has been in our family for three generations. My grandmother perfected it during the 1950s, and it's been our go-to cookie recipe ever since. The secret ingredient? A touch of espresso powder that enhances the chocolate flavor without making the cookies taste like coffee.

Ingredients:
- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp espresso powder (the secret ingredient!)
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips (mix of dark and semi-sweet)
- 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream the softened butter with both sugars until light and fluffy (about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer).

4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract.

5. Gradually blend in the flour mixture. Don't overmix - stop as soon as the flour is incorporated.

6. Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts (if using).

7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges but still soft in the center.

9. IMPORTANT: Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. This ensures they stay chewy!

Baker's Tips:
- For extra chewy cookies, slightly underbake them
- Chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking for thicker cookies
- Use a mix of chocolate chip sizes for better texture
- Store in an airtight container with a slice of bread to keep them soft

Yield: About 48 cookies
Prep time: 15 minutes
Bake time: 10 minutes per batch

My grandmother always said the most important ingredient was love, and I think she was right. These cookies have been the star of every family gathering, bake sale, and holiday celebration. Enjoy!
