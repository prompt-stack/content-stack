# 10 Productivity Hacks for Remote Workers

## 1. Time Blocking
Schedule specific blocks of time for different tasks. This prevents context switching and improves focus.

## 2. The Pomodoro Technique
- Work for 25 minutes
- Take a 5-minute break
- After 4 cycles, take a longer 15-30 minute break

## 3. Create a Dedicated Workspace
Even if it's just a corner of a room, having a "work zone" helps your brain switch into work mode.

## 4. Use the Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately rather than adding it to your to-do list.

## 5. Batch Similar Tasks
Group similar activities together:
- Answer all emails at once
- Make all phone calls in one block
- Do all creative work when you're most energized

## 6. Minimize Digital Distractions
- Use website blockers during focus time
- Turn off non-essential notifications
- Keep your phone in another room

## 7. Take Regular Breaks
Your brain needs rest to maintain productivity. Step away from the screen every hour.

## 8. Establish Morning and Evening Routines
Start and end your workday with consistent rituals to create boundaries.

## 9. Use Task Management Tools
Whether it's Todoist, Notion, or a simple notebook, track your tasks and progress.

## 10. Practice Saying No
Protect your time by declining meetings and requests that don't align with your priorities.
