So over the last couple weeks, I‚Äôve been talking to VCs and founders who have and haven‚Äôt taken VC to learn whether it makes sense for Kinopio. I don‚Äôt think it does.

I‚Äôm open to the idea of selling ~5-10% equity in Kinopio for üí∞ to live a smoother life right now. But the relatively-easy money of VCs has a cost ‚Äì once you get on the VC ferris wheel üé°, the primary goal of a business changes:

Before ‚Äúlets make a great product and sell it to people who love it‚Äù

After üé° ‚Äúwe need fast growth to raise ever-higher rounds of investment until the company gets acquired, so I never have to work again‚Äù

This really clicked for me during a chat with someone who recently took VC:

 I like what I‚Äôm building, and if it dies it‚Äôll be a shame. But it won‚Äôt kill me like it‚Äôs killing my baby that I would‚Äôve loved to work on for the next 10+ yrs.

Maybe that‚Äôs the healthy approach, almost certainly the smart one ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not mine. I want to work on Kinopio for at least a lifetime.

Built to Die, and Secretive About It
Funding models explain why it‚Äôs so hard to rely on software services long-term. Not because of technical problems like crashes, but because they‚Äôre often built to die.

Interesting, cool, and nice-to-use tools and platforms come out all the time. But it‚Äôs annoying to invest the time in learning and relying on something new only for it to get acquired and sunset, or become crappy in the üé° pursuit of growth-at-all-costs.

I‚Äôve found that the best way to predict whether software is made to die is to look at how it‚Äôs funded. What‚Äôs the company‚Äôs business model? How will they make money?

It seems like more and more people are explicitly or intuitively becoming more aware of this. But it‚Äôs still rare for businesses to share how they‚Äôre funded. Advice I got from multiple founders is that if you raise VC, wait 2-3 years to announce it.

On the other-hand, it‚Äôs also not that common for self-sufficient businesses to share their business model either. Maybe they‚Äôre afraid of looking small, or maybe they think that people don‚Äôt care.

Kind of Like Farming


(source)
Two different kinds of farms can grow vegetables. One is a factory farm built for scale, and the other takes the time to grow more expensive but healthier plants without pesticides.

Will everyone appreciate the difference? Of course not, but the latter plants are labelled ‚Äòorganic‚Äô to give us the information and the choice, so that those of us who do care can make better decisions.

Organic Software
So maybe we should have ‚Äòorganic‚Äô software as well, made by companies that:

Are not funded in such a way where the primary obligation of the company is to üé° chase funding rounds or get acquired (so bootstrapping, crowdfunding, grants, and angel investment are okay)
Have a clear pricing page
Disclose their sources of funding and sources of revenue
And, if you are making organic software, please proudly tell the world because we want to know you‚Äôre making something we can rely on.



(from the Kinopio About page)
p.s. I know that software terms like bootstrapped and indie also exist. But these are vaguely defined (is angel investment okay? is having staff okay?), and predominantly speak to founders, instead of to why regular people should care.



p.p.s Thanks to everyone who graciously took the time to talk to me about funding. And special thanks to Aneesha for editing this.

This is a refreshing take to read on building and selling software. Given the long term considerations you have already made in forming Kinopio, what are your plans for when you are inevitably no longer able to keep the operation going due to finances, health or otherwise?

@kyle, that's a really good question. bootstrapping/organic software doesn't have to mean 1-person company. Ideally, I'd love to be able to hire and work other people so it's not all on me.

But fast-forwarding decades from now... I'm not entirely sure, I guess I'd look to see how other companies/stores (software or irl) have handled that

Oh man, that's deep. I found this page by total accident because I was looking for conversion of CSV to obsidian JSON, but instead I've found gold.

I really agree with your statements. I think I really need more passion and emotions in my software.

I have this feeling deep inside, shouting sometimes when I'm doing something in a stupid way because some ignorant higher in corporate hierarchy is wrong again.

On the other hand I feel that I'm afraid of failure, that this thing need to be perfect and somebody need to use it. It's hard also to find time and strength after dealing with regular programming job for whole day.

Anyway, replying to this "what are your plans for when you are inevitably no longer able to keep the operation going due to finances, health or otherwise?"

My own idea in that case is to just give away back to community by open sourcing everything.

Thanks for the post! I've been feeling similarly about many of the software tools I've used, which has also led me to begin making my own diagramming tool. The combination of Kinopio and this post has really made me rethink what kind of software developer I want to be. I still have yet to figure out how to find software companies that want to create software the way I want to.

Hey Thomas, praise doesn't get higher than that. It's definitely an uphill struggle, but I guess the best things in life often are :)
