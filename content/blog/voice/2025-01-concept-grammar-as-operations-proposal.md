So I want to just share market research. I think we're at market research. I want to just, this is a market research report for those of you who are using AI as coding assistants, coding assistants. One of the things these AI models struggle with is naming consistency, language consistency inside of your code base. So you have to build a layer, like your code base is now a layer of abstraction. And the large language models basically need to understand your code base. And so I think that, and so I'll tell you where I play at. And so for me, I'm in web applications, automations, prototyping, right? This is where I'm at. This is my playground, right? I'm a product for this circle of applications, just so you guys can understand. Because I know this is much more difficult to do in like enterprise, major corporations, big teams, right? It's harder, but I think you need to do it. It's just a bigger list. The code base needs to have rules within it. Like your code base is an abstraction layer now, right? You have your front end, right? You have your front end where this is where you can interact with the items that exist in your code base, because you're not writing the code anymore. You're not writing the code anymore, right? We are out of writing the code, right? It's just not efficient, right? So now you've got to figure out how to get efficient with the large language model. You're not going to write the code. Trust me, it is. You're going to be, you're not going to be writing the code anymore. You're going to be saying what you want done. And you're going to review the code. And so you need the large language model to code like you would. You need to, and so what is the language that you use to code? Your code base now needs configuration rules. The actual code base needs rules. It needs a syntax. It needs semantics. It needs to know how should I operate in this code base? What does that look like? It means that you're naming conventions primarily. How should I name what it is that I do? How should I name it? Should I name it? Should I name it? Utilities, functions, folders. Um, um, anything that you can think about that you name. Within your code base, anything that needs to be named, it needs to have a reason why it's named that way. And it needs to be consistent. And it needs to be auditable. It needs to be testable and audible. The large language model needs to be able to self audit. And so that means creating some kind of bash, some script that says that did I follow the naming conventions, right? Am I following the naming conventions? If it has a function, does the function follow this kind of camel case, snake case, whatever the case is, does it follow? And does it reference what it's supposed to do? So how, what is the way, what is the grammar, right? It's the operational grammar. It's operational grammar that exists inside of your code base. Grammar Ops.

## 🧠 **Market Research Insight: GrammarOps for LLM-Native Codebases**

### **Thesis**

In AI-assisted development, your **codebase becomes a programmable language environment**. The *compiler* is now the LLM. To operate effectively, it must learn your "grammar"—your naming conventions, architectural patterns, file structures, and function signatures.

### **Problem**

LLMs are powerful, but contextually brittle:

* They lack memory across files without explicit scaffolding.
* They hallucinate or misname functions.
* They struggle with inconsistent naming, orphaned components, and ambiguous abstractions.

This breaks developer trust.

### **Opportunity**

Treat your codebase as an *instructional interface* for the model. That means:

* Embedding rules for naming, structure, and roles.
* Enforcing predictable patterns.
* Providing runtime self-auditing tools for adherence.

> You’re not writing *code* anymore. You’re designing *linguistic environments* that LLMs can navigate and manipulate.

## 🧩 **Framework: GrammarOps**

### 1. **Declare Your Grammar**

Use a `grammar.json`, `codebase.rules.ts`, or `.llmrc` to define your rules:

```json
{
  "naming": {
    "function": "camelCase",
    "component": "PascalCase",
    "utility": "snake_case"
  },
  "structure": {
    "primitives": "src/components/primitives",
    "composed": "src/components/composed",
    "features": "src/features"
  },
  "prefixes": {
    "utils": "use*",
    "api": "fetch*, post*",
    "hooks": "use*"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Codify Audits**

Write a CLI script (`check-grammar.ts`) that does things like:

* Scan all function names and check against naming rules.
* Flag nonconforming file names or misplaced components.
* Warn when unapproved imports or directory traversals happen.

> LLMs *won’t* always remember, but they *can* be reminded—especially when these rules are referenced in prompt scaffolds.

### 3. **Expose the Interface**

Give your LLMs a consistent entrypoint:

* Place docs and usage examples in `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `PROMPT_GUIDES/`.
* When prompting in ChatGPT/Claude, prepend:
  *“Use the codebase grammar defined in grammar.json to name and place all functions and components.”*

### 4. **Train the "Voice"**

Use few-shot prompting within each domain (e.g., for UI, for API routes) to lock in tone and format. This helps align completion patterns.

## 💡 Why This Matters

The LLM isn’t your engineer—it’s your intern. And that intern is smart but forgetful. You need to:

* Create structure
* Define norms
* Build guardrails
* Allow feedback loops

That’s **GrammarOps**: operationalizing your code grammar for AI-first development.

---

## 🔁 What To Consider Next

* How do you modularize these conventions across multiple projects?
* Could you export/import `grammar.json` across repos?
* Is there a way to *teach* this grammar to AI agents (e.g., via system prompt or model fine-tuning)?

> *“In the era of AI assistants, your naming conventions are not just style—they’re syntax.”*
