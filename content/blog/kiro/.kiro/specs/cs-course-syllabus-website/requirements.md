# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a modern, interactive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website that serves as a comprehensive syllabus for the "Computer Science for Non-Technical Users" course. The website will present the course content in an accessible, visually appealing format that helps non-technical learners understand CS fundamentals needed to effectively work with AI tools for building automations, prototypes, and applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a non-technical learner, I want to access a well-structured course syllabus website so that I can understand the course content and navigate through different topics easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern homepage with course overview
2. WHEN a user navigates the site THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation between different course sections
3. WHEN a user views any page THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent branding and visual design
4. WHEN a user accesses the site on different devices THEN the system SHALL display responsively across desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a course participant, I want to see the course structure and learning objectives so that I can understand what I'll learn and how the content is organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the course overview THEN the system SHALL display the main learning objectives clearly
2. WHEN a user explores the syllabus THEN the system SHALL show all course modules with descriptions
3. WHEN a user views module details THEN the system SHALL display learning outcomes for each section
4. WHEN a user wants to understand prerequisites THEN the system SHALL clearly state that no CS background is required

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to access detailed content for each course module so that I can study the foundational CS concepts in plain English.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a module THEN the system SHALL display the module content with clear explanations
2. WHEN a user reads about abstraction THEN the system SHALL present the concept using real-world analogies and examples
3. WHEN a user studies data structures THEN the system SHALL show visual diagrams and practical examples
4. WHEN a user learns about APIs THEN the system SHALL explain concepts in non-technical language with everyday metaphors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want to see diagrams and interactive elements so that I can better understand complex CS concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views concept explanations THEN the system SHALL include relevant visual diagrams
2. WHEN a user interacts with examples THEN the system SHALL provide interactive demonstrations where appropriate
3. WHEN a user explores data structures THEN the system SHALL display clear visual representations
4. WHEN a user studies abstraction layers THEN the system SHALL show layered diagrams with hover effects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a course participant, I want to track my progress through the course so that I can see what I've completed and what's next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes reading a section THEN the system SHALL allow them to mark it as complete
2. WHEN a user returns to the site THEN the system SHALL remember their progress using local storage
3. WHEN a user views the syllabus THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators of completed sections
4. WHEN a user wants to see overall progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to access practical examples and exercises so that I can apply the concepts I'm learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a concept section THEN the system SHALL provide relevant practice exercises
2. WHEN a user works through examples THEN the system SHALL show step-by-step breakdowns
3. WHEN a user practices with JSON THEN the system SHALL provide interactive JSON examples
4. WHEN a user learns about prompting THEN the system SHALL include example prompts and explanations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a course administrator, I want the website to be easily maintainable and updatable so that I can modify content without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content needs updating THEN the system SHALL use a clear, modular structure for easy maintenance
2. WHEN new modules are added THEN the system SHALL accommodate expansion without major restructuring
3. WHEN visual elements need changes THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
4. WHEN JavaScript functionality needs updates THEN the system SHALL use clean, well-documented code

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the website to load quickly and perform well so that I can focus on learning without technical distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads any page THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on standard internet connections
2. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions
3. WHEN a user interacts with elements THEN the system SHALL respond immediately without lag
4. WHEN a user accesses the site THEN the system SHALL work without requiring external dependencies where possible
