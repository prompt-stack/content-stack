# VS Code as an Abstraction Layer: Connecting Local Development to the Cloud

So right now I'm using VS Code, and because we have terminal agents, I just need something to be able to see the files on my computer, right? I just need, I need a file management. So the window viewer doesn't allow me to edit anything. So basically like Notion is or anything VS Code is good. I like VS Code because it's local and it exists right on my computer. And if I had Dropbox or Google Drive, it can instantly be cloud-based, right? And so what I'm learning now is that when I have stuff on my computer, any computer, right? VS Code becomes an abstraction layer for anything that connects me to the internet. VS Code basically is what connects me to the UI in the browser. And so there's no connection to the UI that exists for Google Drive. Like I'm not connected to it. Like when I, when I make changes in Google Drive, I guess if I come to, let's see, let's, let's see what this looks like. Cause I really want to know. Let's go to Google Drive. And we're going to come here because ultimately what? And then we're going to sync the dev folder. My drive, the dev folder. I would just do prompt stack for now. Yeah. Let's just do prompt stack for now. Yeah. Done. Save. And so if you come back to here, right? Even still, okay. Say this was it. Right. Let's say this was it. This is prompt stack, right? Then I go into content react and I come to, let's say if I go in voice. Yeah. Here's the doc. And I come to this. Open with docs. Like this is just already. And then I put it here. Right. Got it. And so now I'm, I can edit this. Did we get this at it? And so that's your say. Now let's see if it did. It didn't even say. It's just, it's just not a good float. Like there's no connectivity. And so I should be able to just edit it here though. You don't edit in the front end. The front end is where you deploy stuff. The front end is actionable. The browser is making it actionable. Right. That's what connects you like your browser. Editing the content is what you're going to do on your computer. Right. And so you don't need a word document. You can just do it inside of VS code. Right. Like I can use cloud right now in VS code and, and, and, and edit my content. And then I should be able to see my content on the front end to do, to activate it. Once it's done, I should be able to push a button and send it somewhere. Right. That's the level of, of, of, of detail that we have here. I'm going to go a step further and say, Can you take this transcript and store it here?
