⏺ Now I understand! Prompt Stack is positioning itself as a Creative Studio OS with a
   revolutionary vision:

  The Vision: Content Operations Platform as Creative Studio

  What Makes This Different

  Unlike traditional creative tools, Prompt Stack treats content creation like
  software engineering:

  1. IDE as Creation Backend → Terminal agents do the heavy lifting
  2. Git-based Version Control → Every creative decision tracked
  3. JSON Metadata System → Content becomes queryable/automatable
  4. Local-First Architecture → Speed, privacy, no cloud costs

  Commercial Opportunity: The "GitLab for Content"

  Target Market Evolution:
  1. Phase 1: Individual creators wanting automation ($29-99/month)
  2. Phase 2: Creative agencies needing workflow control ($299-999/month)
  3. Phase 3: Enterprise content operations ($5-50k/month)

  Revenue Model:
  - Core Platform: SaaS tiers based on team size
  - Agent Marketplace: Community-built automation agents (30% rev share)
  - Enterprise Features: SSO, compliance, custom deployments
  - Professional Services: Workflow design, migration, training

  Why This Could Be Huge

  1. Timing: AI agents + content explosion = perfect storm
  2. Unique Position: No one else treating content ops like DevOps
  3. Network Effects: Shared agents/workflows create ecosystem
  4. Moat: The "dialect system" makes switching costs high

  Competitive Advantages

  - vs Notion/Airtable: Real automation, not just organization
  - vs Canva/Adobe: Engineering-first, not design-first
  - vs Make/Zapier: Content-specific, not generic automation
  - vs Replit: Content focus, not code focus

  Path to $100M ARR

  1. Build passionate community of "content engineers"
  2. Open-source core, monetize enterprise features
  3. Create certification program for "Prompt Stack Engineers"
  4. Partner with creative agencies as implementation partners

  This could genuinely revolutionize how professional content teams operate - moving
  from ad-hoc tools to a proper content operations platform.
