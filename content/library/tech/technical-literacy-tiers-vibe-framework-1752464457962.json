  "title": "Technical Literacy Tiers VIBE Framework",
  "summary": "A 5-tier technical literacy gradient mapping how different audiences understand tech vocabulary, with practical application to the VIBE framework for progressive onboarding and communication strategies",
  "key_points": [
    "Technical vocabulary falls on a 5-tier gradient from everyday language to engineering core",
    "Most startup content assumes Tier 3 understanding, leaving Tier 2 users behind",
    "VIBE framework (Vision, Interface, Backend, Execution) can be explained at different tier levels",
    "Webhooks are Tier 4 concepts requiring dev-adjacent understanding",
    "Progressive disclosure and tier-matched language enables better user onboarding"
  ],
  "hooks": [
    "There's a hidden 'technical literacy gradient' that determines who understands your product",
    "Most startup content assumes Tier 3 understanding - here's why that's a problem",
    "How to explain the same concept at 5 different technical literacy levels"
  ],
  "quotable_moments": [
    "Most startup or tech content assumes Tier 3 understanding. It drops terms like 'framework' or 'API' without explanation",
    "CLI at Tier 4 - The acronym barrier is real. Even 'command line' feels intimidating",
    "Instead of requiring people to climb from Tier 2 to Tier 4 before they can build anything meaningful, VIBE development lets them start where they are"
