  "title": "Vibe Coders Marketplace Opportunity",
  "summary": "Analysis of the emerging market opportunity for traditional developers to sell templates and tools to 'vibe coders' - non-developers using LLMs to build software without traditional coding knowledge",
  "key_points": [
    "Vibe coders are non-developers using AI to build software, creating a new market for developer-made templates",
    "Traditional GitHub sharing doesn't work for this audience - they need LLM-readable, plug-and-play solutions",
    "Key products needed: drop-in feature modules, prompt-optimized docs, maintenance subscriptions",
    "Pricing model should focus on continuity and support, not just code (lite $49-99, pro $15-25/mo)",
    "When you can't code, the codebase itself must become your co-pilot, facilitating the LLM workflow"
  ],
  "hooks": [
    "The biggest market opportunity right now: developers selling to vibe coders",
    "When you can't code, the codebase needs to work on your behalf",
    "The human is the driver, the codebase is the car, the LLMs are the pit crew"
  ],
  "quotable_moments": [
    "If you don't know how to code, then you need the codebase to work on your behalf",
    "Traditional developers selling to vibe coders... they're just going to give it to a large language model to say, hey, implement this feature into my project",
    "The opportunity isn't just 'sell code.' It's sell velocity and safety to a generation of builders who think in prompts, not functions"
