There are several consumer-facing and small-business apps that offer similar functionality to Microsoft SharePoint, particularly around **collaboration, document management, and knowledge sharing**, but in a more accessible, user-friendly, or affordable package.

Here are some notable alternatives designed for individuals, families, or small teams that don't require enterprise complexity:

- **Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)**  
  Includes Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and more. Enables sharing, real-time editing, and cloud storage, making it easy for families and teams to collaborate on documents and projects anywhere. There's a free tier for personal use and affordable paid plans for groups[4].

- **Dropbox Paper**  
  Offers collaborative document editing, comments, file storage, and simple project management. User-friendly with a free version, it's ideal for small groups who want to store and co-edit files in the cloud without complex setup[4].

- **Microsoft OneDrive**  
  For personal Microsoft accounts, OneDrive can be set up with shared folders (for example, a “Family” folder), enabling easy file sharing and collaboration. While it lacks SharePoint’s advanced custom workflows, it covers basic document management needs for consumers[6].

- **Monday.com**  
  Provides intuitive project tracking, collaborative docs, file sharing, and easy organization. It can be used for both personal and team productivity, with a forever-free plan for two users[4].

- **Slite**  
  Designed around a team wiki, with easy knowledge sharing, collaborative documentation, and a focus on simplicity. Requires very little technical skill to get started, suitable for non-technical users[4].

- **Clinked**  
  While more business-oriented, it offers an easy client portal and secure document sharing, and is well-suited for small businesses or families that need a branded or private group environment[5].

- **Samepage**  
  Provides a modular workspace for projects, file sharing, meetings, and discussions. Integrates with popular cloud storage solutions and has a lower learning curve[5].

**Key differences** from SharePoint:
- Most alternatives favor simplicity, minimal setup, and self-service, as opposed to SharePoint's enterprise IT orientation.
- These platforms often focus on easy onboarding, instantly usable mobile apps, and built-in collaboration features (comments, notifications, and task lists).
- Some, such as Google Drive/Docs and OneDrive, are likely already familiar to consumers.

**Limitations:**  
While these consumer-oriented apps cover most needs—document storage, sharing, editing, and simple project tracking—they may lack the deep workflow automation, custom site development, or advanced permissions of SharePoint. But for most home and small team settings, they're much easier to use and manage[4][5][6].

If your needs are strictly personal or family sharing, **Google Drive/Docs** or **OneDrive** are the simplest drop-in solutions. For small teams desiring richer collaboration, **Monday.com, Dropbox Paper, or Slite** are worth trying.
