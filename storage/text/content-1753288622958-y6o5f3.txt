In an age of constant connectivity, digital minimalism offers a path to intentional technology use and improved well-being.

Core Principles:
1. Clutter is costly - Every app and notification has a cognitive price
2. Optimization matters - Use technology to support your values
3. Intentionality is satisfying - Conscious choices lead to fulfillment

Practical Steps:
- Digital Declutter: Remove non-essential apps for 30 days
- Operating Procedures: Define when/how you use specific technologies
- High-Quality Leisure: Replace digital entertainment with meaningful activities

Benefits:
- Improved focus and productivity
- Better sleep quality
- Stronger real-world relationships
- Reduced anxiety and FOMO
- More time for deep work and hobbies

Start small: Choose one digital habit to change this week. Perhaps check email only twice daily or keep your phone outside the bedroom.

Remember: Technology should serve you, not the other way around.
