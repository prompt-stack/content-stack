React Server Components represent a new paradigm in React development that allows components to be rendered on the server, reducing bundle sizes and improving performance.

Key benefits include:
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Direct database access
- Automatic code splitting
- Improved SEO and initial page load

Server Components can fetch data directly without needing client-side state management or effects. This simplifies data fetching patterns and reduces the complexity of modern React applications.

Example usage:
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await db.posts.findById(id);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}

The future of React is moving towards a hybrid model where developers can choose the best rendering strategy for each component.
