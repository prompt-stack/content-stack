Quality sleep is the foundation of good health, yet millions struggle with sleep issues. Understanding sleep science can help optimize your rest and improve overall well-being.

The Sleep Cycle:
1. Stage 1: Light sleep (5-10 minutes)
2. Stage 2: Deeper relaxation (10-25 minutes)
3. Stage 3: Deep sleep (20-40 minutes)
4. REM Sleep: Dream stage (10-60 minutes)

Tips for Better Sleep:
