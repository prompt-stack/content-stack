# CSS Audit: playground.css

**File**: `/src/styles/pages/playground.css`  
**Type**: Page  
**Status**: ⚠️ MOSTLY COMPLIANT

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Good BEM Implementation
- Uses `.playground__` prefix consistently for most classes
- Wrapped in `@layer pages` (good practice)
- Has helpful comments

### ⚠️ Issues Found
- Some BEM violations in nested elements
- Contains generic component classes that don't belong
- Element selectors present
- Duplicate grid class name

### Class Inventory

#### Properly Prefixed Classes ✅
- `.playground` - Base container ✅
- `.playground__header` - Header section ✅
- `.playground__title` - Title ✅
- `.playground__description` - Description ✅
- `.playground__nav` - Navigation ✅
- `.playground__nav-item` - Nav item ✅
- `.playground__nav-item.is-active` - Active state ✅
- `.playground__content` - Content area ✅
- `.playground__section` - Section container ✅
- `.playground__demo` - Demo container ✅
- `.playground__demo-grid` - Demo grid ✅ (but duplicated later)
- `.playground__code` - Code container ✅
- `.playground__form` - Form container ✅
- `.playground__pattern-grid` - Pattern grid ✅
- `.playground__pattern-card` - Pattern card ✅
- `.playground__component` - Component container ✅
- `.playground__component-description` - Component description ✅
- `.playground__demo-section` - Demo section ✅
- `.playground__demo-content` - Demo content ✅
- `.playground__demo-row` - Demo row ✅

#### BEM Violations
- `.playground__pattern-card__icon` ❌ → `.playground__pattern-icon`
- `.playground__demo-section__header` ❌ → `.playground__demo-header`
- `.playground__demo-section__title` ❌ → `.playground__demo-title`
- `.playground__demo-section__code` ❌ → `.playground__demo-code`

#### Generic Classes (Don't belong in page CSS)
- `.form-group` ❌ → Should be in forms.css or `.playground__form-group`
- `.input-group__wrapper` ❌ → Should be in forms.css
- `.input-group__icon` ❌ → Should be in forms.css

#### Element Selectors
- `.playground__nav-item i` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__section h2` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__section h3` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__pattern-card h3` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__pattern-card p` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__component h2` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__code pre` ❌ (element selector)
- `.playground__demo-section__code pre` ❌ (element selector)
- `.form-group label` ❌ (element selector)

#### Duplicate Class Name
- `.playground__demo-grid` appears twice with different styles (lines 105 and 245)

## Issues Found

### 🔴 Major Issues
1. **Double underscore violations** - Using `__` twice in same selector
2. **Generic component classes** - form-group and input-group don't belong here
3. **Duplicate class definition** - `.playground__demo-grid` defined twice

### 🟡 Medium Issues
1. **Many element selectors** - Should use explicit classes
2. **Cross-component references** - Input group classes

## Task List

- [x] Review naming convention compliance
- [x] Document all classes
- [ ] Fix double underscore violations
- [ ] Remove generic component classes
- [ ] Replace element selectors
- [ ] Resolve duplicate class name
- [ ] Update Playground component
- [ ] Test functionality

## Refactoring Plan

### Fix BEM Violations
```css
/* Current → New */
.playground__pattern-card__icon → .playground__pattern-icon
.playground__demo-section__header → .playground__demo-header
.playground__demo-section__title → .playground__demo-title
.playground__demo-section__code → .playground__demo-code
```

### Remove Generic Classes
```css
/* These should be removed or prefixed */
.form-group → .playground__form-group (or move to forms.css)
.input-group__wrapper → Remove (use from forms.css)
.input-group__icon → Remove (use from forms.css)
```

### Add Classes for Elements
```css
.playground__nav-item i → .playground__nav-icon
.playground__section h2 → .playground__section-title
.playground__section h3 → .playground__section-subtitle
.playground__pattern-card h3 → .playground__pattern-title
.playground__pattern-card p → .playground__pattern-description
.playground__component h2 → .playground__component-title
.playground__code pre → .playground__code-block
.playground__demo-section__code pre → .playground__code-block
.form-group label → .playground__form-label
```

### Resolve Duplicate
Rename one of the `.playground__demo-grid` classes:
- Line 105: Keep as `.playground__demo-grid`
- Line 245: Rename to `.playground__demo-layout-grid`

## Recommendation

This file is **75% compliant**. It follows the page prefix pattern well but has several BEM violations and contains classes that should be in component CSS files.

## Good Practices Found

1. **Consistent prefix** - Uses `.playground__` throughout
2. **Layer usage** - Wrapped in `@layer pages`
3. **State classes** - Proper `.is-active` usage
4. **Responsive design** - Media queries included

## Next Steps

1. Fix double underscore violations
2. Move or remove generic form classes
3. Add specific classes for all elements
4. Resolve duplicate class name
5. Update React component
6. Consider splitting into smaller files if it grows
