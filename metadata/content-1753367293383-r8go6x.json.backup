What did it birth?\n\t4.\tSo geometry was the first math?\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüß† On Discovery vs Invention\n\t5.\tDid we invent math‚Äîor did we just give name to something older than language?\n\t6.\tWe didn‚Äôt invent any of this, right? Some people just invented the language to translate it?\n\n‚∏ª\n\nü§ñ On AI and the Nature of Language\n\t7.\tIf language is rules, and conversation is proof of coexistence, then what does it mean for machines to learn language?\n\t8.\tIf software development is about learning the language of engineering, and machines learn these languages, then can machines construct things far superior to what humans can?\n\t9.\tWould machines need humans to tell them what to build‚Äîor how they want it built?\n\t10.\tIf the design already exists in the world, then is creation even necessary? Or are we just accessing something pre-existing?\n\n‚∏ª\n\n‚úçÔ∏è On Storytelling and Structure\n\t11.\tWhat did I explore with the compass?\n\t12.\tWhat questions did I ask?\n\t13.\tHow do I organize all of this into something coherent?\n\t14.\tHow do I make it all fit together?\n\t15.\tHow would you outline the think piece?\n\t16.\tHow would you lay this out as a full Substack piece?\n\t17.\tCan you extract every question I asked in this thread?",
