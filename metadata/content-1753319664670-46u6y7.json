    "text": "You said:\nSo once you get the thinking down, abstract thinking, the next piece of this is data structures, understanding the data structures that exist that influence all the things that are happening in your automation, your web application, what you're building. So one of the most important data structures that you can use is JSON, J-S-O-N, very, very good foundational data structure. These are really the tools that like ChatGPT and Cloud use when being able to communicate through data. JSON has several different data types, but in general, these are the kind of things, these are the languages that you want to be familiar with. Lists and arrays. So we will go deeper into what lists and arrays are. Dictionaries. These are also called objects or maps. We will go deeper into what these are, because we need to be describing this in plain language, plain language, plain language. Trees. Hierarchies. These are like file trees, decision trees. And then relationship, graphs, relationship between nodes. This has to be simplified. Nodes, lists, arrays. We need plain language, plain language discussion for what these are.\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nAbsolutely — here’s a plain language guide to foundational data structures used in automations, AI prompts, and modern web applications. These are the “mental containers” that tools like ChatGPT and Claude speak in — especially through formats like JSON.\n\n📦 Core Idea: What is a data structure?\nA data structure is just a way to organize information so that it can be stored, used, or passed around — like organizing groceries into bags so you can carry them properly.\n\n🔢 1. Lists / Arrays\nThink: A simple grocery list\n\nPlain English: Just a line-up of things, in order.\n\nExample: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\nUse Case: A list of users, steps in a process, or messages in a conversation.\n\n💡Tip: Everything is in a set order, and you can point to item #1, #2, #3…\n\n🧭 2. Dictionaries / Objects / Maps\nThink: A labeled drawer with named compartments\n\nPlain English: A collection of key-value pairs — every item has a name (key) and a value.\n\nExample:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"name\": \"Rudi\",\n  \"age\": 34,\n  \"role\": \"Founder\"\n}\nUse Case: User profiles, database records, configuration settings.\n\n💡Tip: This is how JSON works at its core — with named fields.\n\n🌲 3. Trees\nThink: A folder system on your computer\n\nPlain English: A branching structure — something has children, and those children can have their own.\n\nExample: A website menu → with submenus → and sub-submenus.\n\nUse Case: File systems, decision trees, organizational hierarchies.\n\n💡Tip: There’s always a root (starting point), and everything flows down.\n\n🔗 4. Graphs\nThink: A map of train stations and tracks between them\n\nPlain English: A web of connected points — each point is a node, and the connections are called edges.\n\nExample:\n\nRudi → follows → Brandon\n\nBrandon → works with → Vince\n\nUse Case: Social networks, recommendation engines, dependency mapping.\n\n💡Tip: There’s no strict \"top\" or \"bottom\" — just relationships.\n\n📄 5. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\nThink: A universal language that combines the above structures\n\nPlain English: A format to describe data using objects and lists.\n\nExample:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    { \"name\": \"Rudi\", \"role\": \"Founder\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Vince\", \"role\": \"Engineer\" }\n  ]\n}\nUse Case: APIs, automation tools, AI prompts, web apps.\n\n💡Tip: You’ll see this everywhere in web and AI tools — it's the glue.\n\n🧠 Why This Matters\nIf abstraction is the architecture, then data structures are the building materials. Everything you automate, prototype, or ask an AI to do happens in these shapes. Once you recognize them — you can read, write, debug, and design better systems.\n\nWould you like visual diagrams for each of these next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nSo, data structures are just a way to be able to organize information so that it can be stored so that it can be used and passed around. Think of it as like organizing groceries into the grocery bag so you can carry them properly. You don't want to put the eggs at the bottom of the grocery bag or chips or things that will get crushed. Similarly, you want to understand how you're organizing your data structure and how things should happen. And so we're going to list out a couple very important key data structures that you should know because having this language will help you better communicate with your large language model, better communicate with ChatGPT in terms of how you want your information stored and organized. And so the first one is a list or an array. And so you can think of this as like a grocery list. This is just a lineup of things in order. And so you can think of apple, banana, cherry inside of brackets. This would be a list or array. This is how it would look. This is how ChatGPT would understand it. There's a lot of different use cases for this. You can, a list of users, you could put all your users in something. You can do a step-by-step list, a step-by-step process of how to do something. These can be the messages that exist within a conversation or a thread. And so this is a really important, very powerful data structure that you can talk to with ChatGPT. The next one is dictionaries, objects, maps. These are all interchangeable ways of being able to talk to depending on what programming language you are in. And so this is like a labeled drawer with the name compartments. If you think about cabinet or a drawer, it has handles that you can pull out. This is what the compartments are. And so this looks like inside of brackets, you would have name, age, role, city. You would have these things in there. And so it looks very similar to a list, but the list is, of course, a lineup of things. And the dictionary and the objects is like a drawer. These things are related. These things are related to each other. They're all in a certain compartment. They're inside of a drawer. So if you think about that conceptually in your mind. And so this typically looks like if you have database, like Microsoft Excel, if you have Microsoft Excel, how you structure information to a person, configuration settings, database records, user profiles, that's really tech. Then there's like trees, decision trees or file trees. This is a branching structure where there's a parent and then there's children. You'll hear these, parent and children. And some of those children also have children. And so it's kind of like this waterfall that looks like this. So if you look like this, you can see in website menus with sub menus and sub menus. This is your file systems. You get into more complex decision trees. Organizational hierarchies is what this is. There's always a root starting point and everything flows down. The next one is graphs. So you think of a map of like train stations and tracks between them. It's really like a web of connected points. Each point is a node, right? Nodes is just a point in a web of connected points and the connections are called edges. And so what does this look like? Rudy follows Brandon. These aren't good examples. We need better examples, more everyday examples, use cases, social media networks, recommendation engines. This is all way too complicated. People need to have this simplified. Then there's JSON, which is JavaScript Object Notation. And JSON is a very, very, very, very powerful, it's a universal language that combines all of the above structures. And so JSONs have all of these data types that can exist within a JSON file. And so this is extremely powerful for when we get to API, automation tools, AI prompts, web apps, like this is going to be the foundation of your understanding.\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nThis is a strong start — but to tighten it up and make it more instructional, I suggest turning it into a clean teaching script with clearer sections, shorter sentences, and consistent metaphors. Here's a refined version with simpler language, visual metaphors, and better real-world examples for each structure:\n\n🧠 Why Data Structures Matter (in plain English)\nWhen you're building with AI, web apps, or automations, you’re always organizing information — just like groceries in a bag. You don’t throw everything in randomly. You organize things so they don’t get crushed and so you can find what you need.\n\nData structures are how you organize digital information so it can be stored, used, and passed between systems like ChatGPT, APIs, or automations.\n\n🧺 1. List / Array\nA grocery list. One item after the other.\n\nWhat it is: An ordered list of items.\n\nHow it looks:\n[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\nHow to imagine it: Like a checklist — each item has a position.\n\nEveryday examples:\n\nA list of tasks in your planner\n\nA playlist of songs\n\nStep-by-step recipe instructions\n\nWhy it matters: Many automations or AI tasks use lists to loop through steps or process multiple items.\n\n🗃️ 2. Dictionary / Object / Map\nA labeled drawer with compartments.\n\nWhat it is: A set of named fields — each with a value.\n\nHow it looks:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"name\": \"Rudi\",\n  \"age\": 34,\n  \"role\": \"Founder\"\n}\nHow to imagine it: A drawer with labels: “Name”, “Age”, “Role.”\n\nEveryday examples:\n\nA contact card in your phone\n\nA user profile on a website\n\nA row in a spreadsheet\n\nWhy it matters: This is the most common format used in JSON and APIs. It lets you name your data.\n\n🌳 3. Tree\nA folder system or family tree.\n\nWhat it is: A branching structure — one thing connects to many others.\n\nHow it looks:\nA → B → C\n↘ D\n\nHow to imagine it: Like a file system on your computer:\n\nFolder → Subfolder → File\n\nEveryday examples:\n\nWebsite menus (Home > About > Team)\n\nOrganization chart (CEO > VPs > Managers)\n\nDecision trees (Yes/No logic paths)\n\nWhy it matters: Trees help you organize things that follow a parent → child relationship.\n\n🔗 4. Graph\nA subway map or a web of relationships.\n\nWhat it is: A network of connected points.\n\nHow it looks:\n(You) ←→ (Friend) ←→ (Event)\n\nHow to imagine it: Like a friendship network — people connected in many directions.\n\nEveryday examples:\n\nSocial media: Who follows whom\n\nMaps: Cities connected by roads\n\nRecommendations: “Because you liked X…”\n\nWhy it matters: Graphs are used when relationships matter more than hierarchy or order.\n\n📄 5. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\nA universal container — mixes lists and dictionaries.\n\nWhat it is: A file format that holds structured data in a readable way.\n\nHow it looks:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    { \"name\": \"Rudi\", \"role\": \"Founder\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Vince\", \"role\": \"Engineer\" }\n  ]\n}\nHow to imagine it: Like a suitcase with labeled compartments and lists inside.\n\nEveryday examples:\n\nChatGPT’s input/output format\n\nWeb automation tools (like Zapier, Make, or n8n)\n\nAPI responses from almost every modern website or app\n\nWhy it matters: JSON is how machines talk. If you know how to shape your data into JSON, you can talk to almost any modern system or AI tool.\n\n🧠 Bottom Line\nIf abstraction is how you see the system,\ndata structures are how you organize the pieces inside it.\n\nWhen you ask ChatGPT to:\n\n“return a list of ideas” → use a list\n\n“give me a detailed profile” → use a dictionary\n\n“map out my team org chart” → use a tree\n\n“show how ideas connect to each other” → use a graph\n\n“format this for my automation tool” → use JSON\n\nWould you like me to generate SVG visuals for each of these next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\nCan you create images in this style for data structures\n\n\n2/2\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nImage created\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nYou said:\nCan get a landscape 16:9 design for a power point too ?\n\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nImage created\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nYou said:\nwhat would you say our prompt for communicting htis is .. in plain english?\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nHere’s a plain English prompt to describe what we’re communicating with these visuals and lesson:\n\n\"Help people understand that data structures are just different ways to organize information — like packing groceries — so computers, AIs, and apps can work with it more easily. Use simple metaphors like grocery bags, file folders, or subway maps to explain lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs.

Want me to help you turn that into a slide caption, social post, or voiceover script?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nso can we standiaze this becasue i have other topics too\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nYes — let’s build you a standard prompt template for communicating any technical concept (like data structures, APIs, recursion, etc.) in plain English with visuals and metaphors.\n\n✅ Standardized Communication Prompt Template (Plain English Educational Visuals)\nGoal: Teach [TOPIC] using a simple metaphor and beginner-friendly tone.\nAudience: People with no formal CS background but who want to build or use AI, automation, or software tools.\n\n🔧 Prompt Template:\n“Explain the concept of [TOPIC] in plain English using a relatable everyday metaphor.\nUse visual storytelling with flat, minimalist illustrations.\nBreak the topic down into 3–5 key ideas or sub-concepts.\nFor each, give:\n– A simple definition\n– A real-world analogy\n– A visual representation (e.g. grocery bag, subway map, file folder)\n– A short note on why this matters when using AI tools, coding, or building systems.\nKeep the tone helpful, non-technical, and beginner-friendly.”\n\n🔁 Example for Data Structures:\n\"Explain the concept of data structures in plain English using the metaphor of packing groceries.\nUse visual storytelling in a flat, minimalist style.\nBreak it down into lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs.\nFor each one, explain what it is, give a real-world analogy (e.g. grocery list, labeled drawer, folder system, subway map), and show how it’s used in tools like ChatGPT or automation platforms.\nKeep the tone warm, helpful, and beginner-friendly.”\n\n🔁 Example for APIs:\n\"Explain APIs in plain English using the metaphor of a restaurant menu and waiter.\nUse minimalist visuals and break it down into key ideas: endpoints, requests, responses, authentication.\nDescribe each with simple terms, an analogy (e.g. ordering food), and a visual.\nExplain how it helps people connect apps or talk to ChatGPT.\"\n\nLet me know the next topic and I’ll plug it into this template. Want me to turn this into a reusable card or file for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nokay lets lay it out and bring it all together for data stuctures\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nPerfect — here’s the complete standardized educational breakdown for “Data Structures”, using our plain English teaching template. It’s structured for slides, voiceover, blog post, or visual script reuse.\n\n📦 Understanding Data Structures (in Plain English)\nA Beginner-Friendly Guide with Everyday Metaphors\n🎯 Goal\nHelp beginners understand what data structures are, why they matter, and how they show up in AI tools, automations, and web development — using simple, visual metaphors.\n\n🧰 Core Prompt Template (for visuals + script)\n“Explain the concept of data structures in plain English using the metaphor of organizing groceries.\nUse flat design, minimalist illustrations.\nBreak it down into 4–5 key types: list, dictionary, tree, graph, and JSON.\nFor each one, describe:\n\nWhat it is\n\nReal-world analogy\n\nVisual representation\n\nWhy it matters in AI or app building\nKeep the tone clear, visual, and beginner-friendly.”\n\n🧠 What Are Data Structures?\nA data structure is a way to organize information — so it can be stored, used, and passed around by computers or AI.\n\nThink of it like packing groceries into a bag.\nYou organize heavy stuff on the bottom. You keep fragile items safe.\nThe better you pack it, the easier it is to carry and use later.\n\n🧺 1. List / Array\nWhat it is: A simple ordered list of items.\n\nAnalogy: A grocery list\nVisual: A vertical checklist inside a notepad or a numbered grocery list\nLooks like (JSON):\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nWhy it matters:\nUsed for steps, loops, user lists, and sequences — core to how AI stores and loops over data.\n\n🗃️ 2.

Tree\nWhat it is: A branching structure with parents and children.\n\nAnalogy: A folder system or family tree\nVisual: A root folder → subfolders → files\nWhy it matters:\nUsed in file systems, menus, decision flows. A must for organizing anything hierarchical.\n\n🔗 4. Graph\nWhat it is: A web of connected points (nodes).\n\nAnalogy: A subway map or a web of friends\nVisual: Dots connected by lines with arrows or loops\nWhy it matters:\nUsed in social networks, recommendations, relationships — anywhere connection matters more than order.\n\n📄 5. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\nWhat it is: A universal way to store structured data using lists and dictionaries.\n\nAnalogy: A suitcase with labeled pouches and checklists\nVisual: A briefcase filled with folders (objects) and checklists (arrays)\nLooks like:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    { \"name\": \"Rudi\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Vince\" }\n  ]\n}\nWhy it matters:\nUsed in APIs, prompts, and automations. If you're building with AI, you’re using JSON.\n\n🎯 Final Takeaway\nData structures are how information is shaped for computers.\nIf abstraction is how you see a system,\ndata structures are how you organize what goes inside it.\n\nKnowing these structures helps you:\n\nGive better prompts to ChatGPT\n\nRead and write JSON\n\nBuild apps or automations that actually work\n\nWould you like this exported as:\n\n📽️ Slide deck\n\n📄 Printable handout\n\n🧑‍🏫 Script for voiceover\n\n🎨 Image storyboard\n\nOr should we move to the next topic and reuse the template?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nso JSON casn have all differnt kind of data type too right?\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nExactly — JSON can hold multiple types of data structures and values inside it. That’s what makes it such a flexible, universal format. It’s like a “container for containers.”\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the core data types you can store inside JSON, in plain English:\n\n📦 JSON Can Hold:\n1. Strings (Text)\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"name\": \"Rudi\" }\nThink: words, names, labels\n\nAlways wrapped in quotes \"...\"\n\n2. Numbers\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"age\": 34, \"score\": 95.5 }\nThink: whole numbers, decimals\n\nNo quotes needed\n\n3. Booleans (True/False)\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"isAdmin\": true }\nThink: yes/no, on/off, true/false logic\n\nJust true or false (no quotes)\n\n4. Null\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"nickname\": null }\nThink: empty on purpose, not yet set\n\n5. Arrays (Lists)\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"tags\": [\"ai\", \"automation\", \"workflow\"] }\nThink: a checklist, an ordered lineup\n\n6. Objects (Dictionaries)\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"name\": \"Rudi\",\n    \"role\": \"Founder\"\n  }\n}\nThink: labeled compartments\n\nThese can also be nested inside other objects or arrays\n\n✅ JSON = Combinations of Everything\nHere’s a mixed example showing all of the above:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"name\": \"Rudi\",\n  \"age\": 34,\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"nickname\": null,\n  \"skills\": [\"AI\", \"Web Dev\", \"Automation\"],\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"title\": \"Founder\",\n    \"city\": \"Cincinnati\"\n  }\n}\n🧠 Why It Matters\nWhen you’re prompting ChatGPT, calling an API, or structuring data for automation tools — knowing these types lets you:\n\nStructure your response precisely\n\nHandle dynamic inputs and outputs\n\nDebug formatting issues\n\nWant a visual cheat sheet showing these JSON types in the same illustration style?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nokay lets lay this out and bring it all together, we need to discuss this in plain english for non CS user looking to build automatins, protoytpes and apps with llms assitnace\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nGreat — here’s a full plain-English teaching module for JSON & Data Types, designed for non-CS users building automations, prototypes, or apps with LLMs (e.g., in Make, Zapier, Claude, ChatGPT, Supabase, etc.).\n\n📄 Understanding JSON & Data Types\nFor Non-Technical Builders Using AI, Automation, or APIs\n🔍 What Is JSON?\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the language of data that apps, automations, and AI tools use to talk to each other.\n\nThink of JSON like a well-organized suitcase filled with:\n\nLabeled folders (objects),\n\nChecklists (arrays/lists),\n\nAnd notes (text, numbers, etc.)\n\nMost of the time, when ChatGPT “returns” data, when an API gives you a response, or when an automation moves info from one tool to another — it’s all done in JSON.\n\n🧰 Why You Should Care\nIf you're:\n\nBuilding workflows in Make, Zapier, or n8n\n\nQuerying APIs with GPT\n\nSending or receiving info between apps\n\nStructuring prompts for Claude, ChatGPT, or LangChain\n\n...then you're already working with JSON — even if you don’t realize it.\n\n🧠 JSON Is a Container — But What’s Inside?\nJSON supports 6 basic data types you must recognize:\n1. 🧾 String = text\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"name\": \"Rudi\" }\nPlain English: Words in quotes.\n\nThink: Labels, usernames, messages.\n\n2. 🔢 Number = integer or decimal\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"score\": 98, \"balance\": 45.75 }\nPlain English: Just a number. No quotes.\n\nThink: Age, price, points.\n\n3. ✅ Boolean = true / false\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"isActive\": true }\nPlain English: Yes or no.\n\nThink: Light switch, toggle, on/off.\n\n4. ⛔ Null = nothing\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"nickname\": null }\nPlain English: Blank on purpose.\n\nThink: “We don’t have that info yet.”\n\n5. 📋 Array = list of items\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"tags\": [\"ai\", \"design\", \"automation\"] }\nPlain English: A checklist.\n\nThink: Grocery list, list of users, multiple results.\n\n6. 🗂️ Object = labeled fields (dictionary)\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{ \"user\": { \"name\": \"Rudi\", \"role\": \"Founder\" } }\nPlain English: A folder with labels inside.\n\nThink: Contact card, form response, profile data.\n\n🔁 You Can Nest Them All\nThat’s the beauty of JSON — you can combine all of these types:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"name\": \"Rudi\",\n  \"isActive\": true,\n  \"tags\": [\"ai\", \"automation\"],\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"role\": \"Founder\",\n    \"city\": \"Cincinnati\"\n  },\n  \"nickname\": null\n}\nText + true/false + lists + folders + blanks.\n\nThis is exactly the format used in Claude or GPT responses, and API payloads.\n\n🧪 Why This Matters (When Building)\nIf you’re:\n\nPrompting ChatGPT: Ask it to return structured JSON with specific fields\n\nUsing Make or Zapier: Map JSON keys to automation steps\n\nConnecting APIs: Send and receive requests in JSON\n\nBuilding frontends: Store form data in JSON\n\nUsing Supabase/Firestore/Airtable: Your rows and records follow object and array structures\n\nJSON is the glue between the steps, tools, and systems you’re stitching together with AI.\n\n✅ Final Takeaway\nJSON is how tools talk.\nIt's how ChatGPT thinks.\nIt’s how your automations pass data around.\nIf you learn to read and shape it, you can build anything.\n\nWould you like a slide version, video script, or infographic format next?",
