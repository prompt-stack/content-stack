    "text": "In an age of constant connectivity, digital minimalism offers a path to intentional technology use and improved well-being.\n\nCore Principles:\n1. Clutter is costly - Every app and notification has a cognitive price\n2. Optimization matters - Use technology to support your values\n3. Intentionality is satisfying - Conscious choices lead to fulfillment\n\nPractical Steps:\n- Digital Declutter: Remove non-essential apps for 30 days\n- Operating Procedures: Define when/how you use specific technologies\n- High-Quality Leisure: Replace digital entertainment with meaningful activities\n\nBenefits:\n- Improved focus and productivity\n- Better sleep quality\n- Stronger real-world relationships\n- Reduced anxiety and FOMO\n- More time for deep work and hobbies\n\nStart small: Choose one digital habit to change this week. Perhaps check email only twice daily or keep your phone outside the bedroom.\n\nRemember: Technology should serve you, not the other way around.",
