Grammar Ops takes a systematic approach to making\n   codebases more AI-friendly through structured naming, metadata, and architectural constraints.\n\n  Strengths:\n  - Token efficiency - The metadata approach to reduce context from 1500 to 20 tokens is clever\n  - Systematic grammar - Mapping natural language patterns to code (verbs=functions,\n  nouns=components) is intuitive\n  - Comprehensive tooling - Extensive validation and auditing scripts\n  - Clear hierarchy - The primitive→composed→features→pages architecture prevents circular\n  dependencies\n  - LLM-first design - Explicitly optimized for AI assistance rather than retrofitted\n\n  Potential concerns:\n  - High overhead - Significant metadata maintenance burden\n  - Rigidity - Very prescriptive approach might constrain creative solutions\n  - Team adoption - Requires everyone to learn and follow extensive conventions\n  - Complexity - Could be overkill for smaller projects\n\n  Bottom line: T..."
